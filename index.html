          <p id="tribute-info">
            Harriet Tubman was born in approximately March 1822. Her given name
            was Arminta Harriet Ross. She was one of 9 children born to enslaved
            parents, Harriet "Rit" Green, and Ben Ross. Her mother was owned by
            Mary Pattison Brodess, and her father was owned by Anthony Thompson.
            Thompson and Brodess eventually married.
          </p>

          <p id="tribute-info">
            Harriet endured violence from a young age. She recalled getting 5
            lashes one time before breakfast, which gave her lasting scars.
            Another incident occurred when she was sent on an errand to the dry
            goods store. Another slave had left the fields without permission,
            and the owner demanded Harriet help restrain the runaway. When
            Harriet refused, the man threw a brick and hit Harriet in the head.
            She suffered from epilesy, uncontrollable sleep episodes, and severe
            headaches after this event.
          </p>
          <p id="tribute-info">
            Harriet is most remembered for helping slaves to find freedom. She
            used the "Underground Railroad" to escape to freedom, and then went
            on to help her family and others to escape via the Underground
            Railroad themselves. You can read more about

            In her later years, Harriet built a house for old people on her
            property. She eventually lived in the "Old Folks Home" until her
            death.

          In April, 2016 the Treasury Department announced that Harriet Tubman
          would replace Andrew Jackson on the twenty dollar bill. The release
          date is set for 2026, however, recently the Biden administration
          announced plans to speed up the process to release the new bills
          sooner than originally thought. Harriet Tubman deserves to be honored
          for her role in helping free slaves.
